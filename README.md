Bid Web Scraper
======

Part of my job with a ?????????? company involves constantly checking around 60 websites on which local governments will post requests to see price quotes for items they'd like to procure. The URLs of these websites are stored in a company Excel sheet. Instead of inflicting more physical pain on my mouse hand than I already have by clicking through every URL, I'm writing a Python script that, when manually run, instantly updates our Excel sheet with the number of new bid requests that have been posted to each website.
