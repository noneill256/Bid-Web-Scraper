Bid Web Scraper
======

Part of my job with a ?????????? company involves constantly checking websites on which local governments will post requests to see price quotes for items they'd like to procure. These websites are stored in a company Excel sheet. Instead of inflicting more physical pain on my mouse hand than I already have, I wrote a Python script that, when manually run, automatically updates our Excel with the number of new bid requests that have been posted to each website.
